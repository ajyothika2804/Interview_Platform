# interview_platform
Abstractâ€” This project revolutionizes the hiring process by leveraging AI-powered technology to automate interview assessment. The platform uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It allows the interviewer to pre-load questions and model answers, while candidates record their answers in real-time. The system then intelligently compares the candidate's answer with the model's response. They are graded based on accuracy and alignment of content. This ensures fairness and honesty. An AI-powered proctor checks applicants during remote interviews by looking for signs of malpractice. This solution not only accelerates recruitment but eliminates bias and reduces human intervention. It also increases the efficiency and scalability of the hiring process. Designed for mass recruiting, remote employment, and educational assessment, this project stands at the crossroads of innovation and practical application. It provides significant improvements in both applicant evaluation and operational efficiency for organizations.
